Tickets is a productivity app that helps teams keep track of tasks. 

The app is built using a MongoDB / Express / React / Node stack.

### Assign Status, Owner, Priority, and Schedule.

- Let everyone know at a glance the ticket progress, who is responsible, and how urgent it is.

- Want a team member kept in the loop? Add them to the subscribed section so that the ticket shows up in their Subscribed folder. 

- Need to filter your tickets by custom categories? This is what tags are for.
